## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While working through this project i learned more about media queries, flex-box, grid, and pure css.
... and a method to make grid responsive without media queries:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, 15rem), 1fr));
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Youtube CodelyTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El0OJ6h_2ZI&ab_channel=CodelyTV-Redescubrelaprogramaci√≥n) - This helped me learn autofit and autofill, also how to make the grid responsive with 3 lines.
